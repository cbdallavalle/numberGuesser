Number Guesser

In the Number Guesser project I was given a desktop image to recreate and then was responsible for the functionality of a number guessing game. The javascript randomly picked a number and then allowed the users to guess what number was picked. Depending on what the user picked, the js would return a different message saying their number was too high or low or spot on. I challenged myself to add a fun component and changed the number guesser to make it into a counting game for kiddos. When a user guessed a number, images of barn animals would show up and the user had to count them to guess again. It was quite fun!
